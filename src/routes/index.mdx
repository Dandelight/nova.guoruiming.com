# Welcome!

Hello, I'm Raymond (Ruiming Guo), a second year MSc student at [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/) under supervision of [Xi Peng](https://pengxi.me/).

Currently, my research focus on unsupervised multimodal learning. However, I am now more interested in human-AI interaction and embodied intelligence. My vision is to make the world a better place.

Before graduate school, I enjoyed a memorable college life in Sichuan University, where I descovered my interest in Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering. I was fountunate enough to work with many excellent peers, with whom I compete in competitions, work days and nights working in student clubs. I have worked on many projects, and most of them have been listed below.

My favourite course is computer networks. It demonstrates how a complex task is separated into five layers and came to a global aggrement.

The event that foundamentally changed my life is the China International xx.

Furthermore, I'm really interested in AI-powered Software Engineering, and believes that most softwares will be written or replace by AI agents.

From production to research,

Everlive.

Cutting-edge as well as retro.

One of the qoutes that inspire me most is the [Inaugural Address by John F. Kennedy](https://www.jfklibrary.org/archives/other-resources/john-f-kennedy-speeches/inaugural-address-19610120).

> Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths and encourage the arts and commerce.

There are my [CV](./cv) and [Statement of Purpose](./research/statement-of-purpose).
